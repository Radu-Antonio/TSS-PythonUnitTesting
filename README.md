# Testare Sisteme Software - Python Unit Testing

### TO DO:
- *maybe add wide moves/rotations/slice moves
- to implement CFOP variation of the solver
- to implement pattern solving
- make a scanner for the cube using the camera
- make a 3d representation of it, and animate the moves
- make a layout for the application
- make tests using a library

### HOW TO INSTALL:

## LINUX
- install python3
- make a virtual enviroment using: ```python3 -m venv env```

- now install the packages that we use: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- and you can work

## WINDOWS
- install python
- make a virtual enviroment using: ```python -m venv env```
- activate the env: ```env\Scripts\activate```
- now install the packages that we use: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- and you can work

### WORK FLOW:
- pull all the changes from git
- activate the env
- if requirements.txt is modified update the packages by installing the requirements
- if you need to install a package: ```pip install package_name```
- to update the requirements file with the new packages: ```pip freeze > requirements.txt```
- to deactivate (leave the env): ```deactivate```
- when working always be in the env, deactivate when you're done
